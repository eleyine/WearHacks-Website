**Note**: `setup.sh` will copy `example_private_settings.py` to `private.py`. If you are on your local machine in dev mode, there's no need to edit it. However, if you'd like to deploy, *please update `wearhacks_website/settings/private.py` with your sensitive and deployment-specific settings*.

**Manual install: what's in `setup.sh`?**

If you don't want to use the setup  `setup.sh`

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv wearhacks-website
$ workon wearhacks-website
(wearhacks-website) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```bash
    $ workon wearhacks-website
    (wearhacks-website) $ python manage.py runserver
    ```

* By default, you will use the Django settings then defined in `wearhacks_settings/settings/dev.py`. 
* To use production settings go to the  defined in `wearhacks_settings/settings/prod.py`:

    ```

* You can edit `wearhacks_settings/settings/private.py` to enter sensitive and user-specific settings. All settings in `private.py` will override those defined in `dev.py` and `prod.py`. See `wearhacks_website/settings/__init__.py` for more information.

## Stripe settings

The registration app handles payment via [Stripe](https://stripe.com). To test this feature, edit in your Stripe API keys in your private settings files (`wearhacks_website/*private.py`).

## Deployment on Digital Ocean

I wrote a `fabric` script to automate installation on Digital Ocean droplets using the one-step Django installation. If you are deploying elsewhere, you can have an idea of the steps to take by inspecting `server_files/fabfile.py`. 

Here are the setup instructions if you are readey choose to do  with Digital Ocean. 

* Create a Digital Ocean droplet with a Django installation image
* Ssh into your droplet to obtain the postgresql database password. It will be displayed in the welcome message. 
* Copy `wearhacks_website/settings/private.py` to `wearhacks_website/settings/server_private.py` and uncomment the postgresql settings. Edit in your postgresql password from the step which given above.

* Make sure you have fabric installed locally. If you ran `setup.sh`, you already have it.
* In `wearhacks_website/server_files/`, copy `fab_config_example.py` and rename it to `fab_config.py`. Edit in  your deployment host address.
* Then in `server_files`,or run the  `fab all`
* If you'd like a list of fab commands,then run  `fab -l`
